# Data Visualization

> When communicating results to non-technical types there is nothing better than a clear visualization to make a point.

# Data Visualization

> There are two goals when presenting data: convey your story and establish credibility.

## -Edward Tufte

???
+ Presenter asks: thoughts? Agree? Disagree? Additions?
+ Presenter: all too often, we spit out charts with every piece of data we can think of that could be helpful, vs having a story to share

# Four Steps to Creating an Effective Visualization

--
+ Define your story

--
+ Choose your charts

--
+ Refine your visuals

--
+ Present your story


---

class:middle
# Step 1: Define Your Story

---

# Define Your Story

## There are a few key ingredients:
+ The audience
+ A powerful question
+ The data

---

# The Audience

--
+ Beginner - New to the subject but do not want it overtly elementary

--
+ Generalist - Aware of the topic and looking for general comprehension broken down into major themes

--
+ Manager - Seeks an in-depth, actionable understanding of the specifics. They want details.

--
+ Expert - Needs less storytelling and more details

--
+ Executives - Have little time, so they want to absorb the significant points with conclusions of weighted probabilities

--
###### [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-to-tell-a-story-with-data)

---

# A Powerful Question


+ Asked of you from higher up

+ Something that would be valuable to know in order to make a decision

---

# The Data

+ What data sets do you need to give the full picture?

+ What data points?


---


class:middle
> Never underestimate your audience. It’s the most common mistake made by presenters. It is not about you anymore. It’s about your audience’s relationship with your content.

# Benefits of Excel
--

+ Easy to use
--

+ Very visual
--

+ Lots of features and functions
--

+ Easy to make charts
--

+ Does a lot of formatting for you

---

# Drawbacks of Excel
--

+ Not very intuitive

# A Quick (Re-)Introduction to Excel
## [Click to download the data](data/DOT_complaints.xlsx)
<!-- # Exercise 1: simple exercises to create charts -->

---

# PivotTable
--

+ A data summarization tool for quickly understanding and displaying the data you’re analyzing
--

+ We often use summary counts to create charts. 
--

## TO START: Make sure you don't have a range selected
--

![img-center-100](images/pt1.png)

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-right-50](images/pt2.png)

+ Excel will default to all your data
+ You'll generally create a PivotTable in a new sheet

---

# PivotTable
![img-center-80](images/pt3.png)

---

# PivotTable
+ Click and drag columns (called "fields") into the boxes
+ Boxes labeled "Filter", "Row Labels", "Column Labels", "Values"
![img-center-65](images/pt4.png)

---

# Create a Bar Chart

+ "Insert" ribbon ->  clustered column chart

![img-center-50](images/bar1_box.png)

---

# Create a Bar Chart
![img-center-80](images/bar2.png)

---

# What questions do you think someone would have about the data?
???
+ Walk participants through the stages
+ When it comes time to decide on the question, remind them that, to make the day more interesting, they should chose a more complex problem with multiple steps

--

+ 3 minutes to brainstorm questions on your own
--

+ 3 minutes to share and consolidate your questions with your group
--

+ 3 minutes to decide on a few questions your group will answer today

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis
--

+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers

--

####Tukey, J.W. (1977). Exploratory data analysis. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley

---

# Exploring the Data
???
+ Facilitator releases participants to explore the data on their own
+ Facilitator helps participants with any issues analyzing the data
+ Participants practice presentation skills and articulating their analysis to a group
+ Facilitators emphasize telling a story with data
--

+ Take a moment to begin answering your questions
--

+ Utilize PivotCharts as you explore
--

+ Work in pairs, groups, or on your own
--

+ Create new tabs to answer each question
--

+ Be prepared to share what you found and the steps you took to find it
--

+ We'll be around to help

---

# Use of Color
![img-center-95](images/311_chart5_parks.png)
???
+ Allows categories to be compared together
+ Increases the information density (also saves space)
---

# Use of Color

--

## Use color intentionally to make comprehension and interpretation easier. 
---

# Use of Color


## **For Sequential Numbers**
--

+ Use color scales with the darkest color representing the highest number and the lightest color representing the lowest number
--

+ Consider using two hues running light to dark for even more clarity

---

# Use of Color


## **For Categorical Data**
--

+ Each category gets its own color
---

# Use of Color


## **For Any Type of Data**
--

+ Consider grey to be the most important color. Use it to show the less important data while accentuating value(s) of interest in a color.

# Create Sparklines
+ Create a pivot table of `complaint types` (row labels) and `month-day` (column labels)

![img-center-90](images/sl1.png)

---

# Create Sparklines
+ Select across the first data row (not the labels). 
Don't include the total column!
--

![img-center-50](images/sl3.png)
--

+ Copy and paste the sparkline down

---

# Create Sparklines
 
![img-right-30](images/sl4.png)

# Chart Content
--

+ Every visualization is a mapping between _**data objects and features**_ to _**visual objects and features**_
--

+ We call this process "encoding"

# Let's take a look at some of the more popular types

---

# Type of Chart by Data Type

???
+ In this series of photos, talk the students through the way we chart numeric vs categorical data
+ Point out why bar and pie charts are the most commonly seen (you can use them with any type of data)
+ To progress on to the next slide, ask: what are the two types of data?

--

![img-center-100](images/datatypechart1.png)

# Type of Chart by Data Type


![img-center-100](images/datatypechart2.png)

## Data is always one of two types: numerical and categorical

---

# Type of Chart by Data Type


![img-center-100](images/datatypechart5.png)

## Bar and pie charts can be used to visualize both quantitative and qualitative data

---

# Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart1_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator prompts with question "What are we visualizing here?"
---

# Horizontal Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart3_parks.png)
???
+ Key feature of this chart is labels that are easier to read across and longer range so smaller quantities can be compared
+ Odd for data to be displayed this way vs. vertical bars
---

# Ranked Horizontal Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart4_parks.png)
???
+ Sorting the data allows for data points to be rank-ordered and easier to understand
---

# Grouped Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart6_parks.png)
???
+ Demonstrates the impact of losing color, and how powerful color is as a discriminator in visualizations
---

# Stacked Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart7_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator introduces stacked bar chart, discussing pros (able to compare) with cons (hard to interpret without labels)
+ Solicit feedback from students on what they think of the chart type

---

# 100% Stacked Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart7a_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator introduces 100% stacked bar chart, discussing pros (able to compare proportions) with cons (hard to interpret without labels)
+ Solicit feedback from students on what they think of the chart type
---


# Pie Charts

???
+ Facilitator presents an alternative scenario of many small slices as a potential issue
+ Good to note tendency to add labels to the point of making it a table with color and point out the color reuse in the chart, making it hard to interpret

---

# Type of Chart by Data Type


![img-center-100](images/datatypechart6.png)

## Line charts and dot plots are best for numeric data

---

# Line Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart8_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator discusses when to use a line chart (time-series data connected to each other)
+ Possible to point out the visualization encodes not only the level but the relationship of one to the next (slope of the line)
+ Can point out this is like the heart-beat of the city, or at least of NYC Parks

---


# "Barless" Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart2_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator prompts with question "What are we visualizing here?"
+ Important to let them realize this is the same data and then ask if it is better or worse than previous, and why
+ Good to point out the lack of line between the point and the label, hard to compare across categories
---


# Line Chart with Categorical Data
![img-center-95](images/311_chart9_parks.png)
???
+ This is an example of what not to do with the data. Each category is distinct and not related, though the chart implies it is. Participants will likely have done this before, but should be asked to reflect on whether one category has an impact on another.
+ Good opportunity to reflect on the fact Excel doesn't care about the kind of chart you create and will produce whatever you tell it to
---


# Type of Chart by Data Type


![img-center-100](images/datatypechart7.png)

## Tree maps are best for categorical data

---


name:treemap
# [Treemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping)
![img-center-100](images/treemap_parks.png)
???
+ An alternative visualization that is more advanced, but interesting for it's possibilities (still probably need numbers)
