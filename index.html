# Chart Content
--

+ Every visualization is a mapping between _**data objects and features**_ to _**visual objects and features**_
--

+ We call this process "encoding"

# A Quick (Re-)Introduction to Excel
## [Click to download the data](2019_311_Noise_Complaints.xlsx)
<!-- # Exercise 1: simple exercises to create charts -->

---

# Benefits of Excel
--

+ Easy to use
--

+ Very visual
--

+ Lots of features and functions
--

+ Easy to make charts
--

+ Does a lot of formatting for you

---

# Drawbacks of Excel
--

+ Not very intuitive
--

+ Hard to find what you’re looking for (and they keep moving things around)
--

+ Lots of features and functions
--

+ Easy to make (bad) charts
--

+ Does a lot of formatting for you

---
 
# Common Shortcuts in Excel
--

+ `Ctrl` + `arrow key` -> Go to the end of the text in that direction
--

+ `Ctrl` + `c` -> Copy the selection to clipboard
--

+ `Ctrl` + `v` -> Paste clipboard contents to the cell(s)
--

+ More shortcuts at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-2010-HP010342494.aspx

---

# PivotTable
--

+ A data summarization tool for quickly understanding and displaying the data you’re analyzing
--

+ We often use summary counts to create charts. 
--

## TO START: Make sure you don't have a range selected
--

![img-center-100](images/pt1.png)

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-right-50](images/pt2.png)

+ Excel will default to all your data
+ You'll generally create a PivotTable in a new sheet

---

# PivotTable
![img-center-80](images/pt3.png)

---

# PivotTable
+ Click and drag columns (called "fields") into the boxes
+ Boxes labeled "Filter", "Row Labels", "Column Labels", "Values"
![img-center-65](images/pt4.png)

---

# Create a Bar Chart
--

+ "Insert" ribbon ->  clustered column chart

---

# What questions do you have about the data?
???
+ Walk participants through the stages
+ When it comes time to decide on the question, remind them that, to make the day more interesting, they should chose a more complex problem with multiple steps

--

+ 3 minutes to brainstorm questions you have on your own
--

+ 3 minutes to share and consolidate your questions with your group
--

+ 3 minutes to decide on a few questions your group will answer today

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis
--

+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers

--

####Tukey, J.W. (1977). Exploratory data analysis. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley

---

# Exploring the Data
???
+ Facilitator releases participants to explore the data on their own
+ Facilitator helps participants with any issues analyzing the data
+ Participants practice presentation skills and articulating their analysis to a group
+ Facilitators emphasize telling a story with data
--

+ Take a moment to begin answering your questions
--

+ Utilize PivotCharts as you explore
--

+ Work in pairs, groups, or on your own
--

+Create new tabs to answer each question
--

+ Be prepared to share what you found and the steps you took to find it
--

+ We'll be around to help

# Use of Color

--

## Use color intentionally to make comprehension and interpretation easier. 
---

# Use of Color


## **For Sequential Numbers**
--

+ Use color scales with the darkest color representing the highest number and the lightest color representing the lowest number
--

+ Consider using two hues running light to dark for even more clarity

---

# Use of Color


## **For Categorical Data**
--

+ Each category gets its own color
---

# Use of Color


## **For Any Type of Data**
--

+ Consider grey to be the most important color. Use it to show the less important data while accentuating value(s) of interest in a color.

# Tips for Using Color
--

+ Be sure there's a sufficient difference between your colors
--

+ Color scales are worth exploring
--

+ Watch out for the connotation of certain colors (ex: red)
--

+ Avoid patterns
--

+ Don't use more than 6 colors

# Final Thoughts

+ Don't always (or ever) accept the defaults
--

+ Don't be afraid to experiment
--

+ Reduce clutter (especially chart junk) whenever possible
--

+ Pay attention to your data-ink ratio
--

+ Visualization is a team sport
